Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version control systems are software that help track changes make in code over time. As a developer edits code, the version control system takes a snapshot of the files. It then saves that snapshot permanently so it can be recalled later if needed.

Create workflows
Version control workflows prevent the chaos of everyone using their own development process with different and incompatible tools. Version control systems provide process enforcement and permissions so everyone stays on the same page.

Work with versions
Every version has a description for what the changes in the version do, such as fix a bug or add a feature. These descriptions help the team follow changes in code by version instead of by individual file changes. Code stored in versions can be viewed and restored from version control at any time as needed. Versions make it easy to base new work off any version of code.

Code together
Version control synchronizes versions and makes sure that changes don't conflict with changes from others. The team relies on version control to help resolve and prevent conflicts, even when people make changes at the same time.

Keep a history
Version control keeps a history of changes as the team saves new versions of code. Team members can review history to find out who, why, and when changes were made. History gives teams the confidence to experiment since it's easy to roll back to a previous good version at any time. History lets anyone base work from any version of code, such as to fix a bug in a previous release.1. GitHub
GitHub helps software teams to collaborate and maintain the entire history of code changes. You can track changes in code, turn back the clock to undo errors and share your efforts with other team members.

It is a repository to host Git projects. For those wondering what is Git? It is an open source version control system that features local branching, multiple workflows, and convenient staging areas. Git version control is an easy to learn option and offers faster operation speed.

Perfective Maintenance: This involves improving the software system's performance, maintainability, and usability.
Preventive Maintenance: This involves making changes to the software system to prevent future problems.


Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
1. Unethical data collection
With the shift to digital marketing, companies are exponentially valuing user data. It’s an important source to use in development. However, it’s easy to get carried away in the act of acquiring it. Customers have to be fully aware of what information they’re sharing and how it’s going to be used.

Software developers face a difficult choice regarding personal data. They have two options: develop systems that possibly abuse user data or voice concerns despite going against the project’s objectives.

The best-case scenario is you should be free to voice worries about personal data ownership. If the use case violates privacy, legal, or ethical standards, the organization should investigate further and determine this on its own.

2. Algorithmic bias
Computers cannot understand morality as a concept. When it is not thoroughly checked, its systems can unintentionally show bias. For instance, when it was discovered that Google’s image processing engine couldn’t adequately reflect black and brown skin tones in images, the company came under fire for allegedly fostering systematic racism.

Software developers must deliberate potential biases in developing their products. By studying social norms and analyzing their current data, they can prevent wrong assumptions in the collection and use of information.

On the client’s end, they can prevent these mishaps by fostering a culture that encourages employees to speak up if they think a software feature is inappropriate. Being critical of the product helps address algorithmic prejudice.

3. Weak security
The software industry is prone to security issues. Developers need further education to learn and implement proper security practices. However, these kinds of training are often limited to cybersecurity-specific seminars.

Software experts have to take the initiative in learning security protocols. Fortunately, there are now plenty of development resources to strengthen one’s skills and knowledge about cybersecurity. As a software developer, it is your duty to implement and update your project with standardized security.

Depending on the type of website or application you’re developing, there are now protection guidelines you can refer to. For example, if you’re developing a health application, you can refer to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA).

4. Wrong Priorities
A lot of software engineering teams devote too much time to creating new features and improving the functionality of their products. However, they typically make the mistake of neglecting to customize and improve the existing functions. Unfortunately, in these situations, ethics frequently take a backseat. This may result in some ethical issues in software development.

1. Be proactive
While you work honestly when writing code, there’s no telling where it can lead to. The client and your team can easily veer away from the original purpose of your project. Throughout the process of development, think of the potential threats and misconduct that can happen. As a software engineer, you must assess the current technology you’re developing and take proactive measures to address any potential abuse and other ethical issues in software development.

2. Be honest
Falsely advertising features or exaggerating the performance quality is unethical. Be straightforward and truthful while describing your goods. Inform the audience if the vision changes. Inform stakeholders as soon as there are updates or modifications to the software. To ensure that the product will be utilized as intended, create policies with the help of other teams inside your organization.

3. Be accountable
You should strive to improve the integrity and reputation of the profession as a software engineer. For instance, you should avoid making false claims regarding your application that could be deceptive or misleading. Make sure you keep your employer, clients, customers, and other stakeholders in the loop by reporting software issues and other potential ethical issues in software development.

4. Be a responsible citizen 
Software developers have this opportunity to build a product that will either benefit users or hurt them. Prioritize your responsibilities as a good citizen over your reputation as an expert. Only work on projects that you believe are secure, comply with specifications, and can withstand mandatory testing. By offering your expert technical services to worthy causes, you act responsibly as a citizen.
